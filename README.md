# BitPubscan
Just a tool I created to help scan a small range to see how possible it is to get the matching known public keys of desired bitcoin addresses, only runs on python 3.7 or later.
To run try to get a list of public keys of bitcoin wallets in the same folder for the script to read and match against search.
dependacies
pip3 install bitcoin
